Before running skybot, make sure you set the discord_api_key and
weather_api_key to your bot's token and the token from your
openweathermap.org api key, respectively. example:

[APIdata]
weather_api_key = *your key here*
discord_api_key = *your key here*

if this is not done, skybot WILL raise errors.
